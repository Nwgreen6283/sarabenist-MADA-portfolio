    "text": "Introducing me!\nMy name is Sara Benist, and I am a second year Master of Public Health student at the University of Georgia concentrating in Epidemiology. After completing my undergraduate degree in Health Promotion from UGA, I served my community as an AmeriCorps VISTA member and leader for two years at the Georgia-based non-profit Helping Mamas before returning to school for my Master’s degree.\nWith my BS in Health Promotion and MPH, I have a background in fundamental epidemiology practices, writing professional papers including policy memos and meta-analyses, and other public health practices. I have fundamental knowledge in SAS and Stata through my Introductory Biostatistics and Epidemiology courses, and my Foundations in R Coding course provided a solid foundation in R and its related programs. I enjoy coding in R for the flexibility in what I can code as well as the versatility of the programming language. With the MADA course, I would like to build upon my coding knowledge and learn more about real-world data analysis practices and be confident in performing them.\nFun fact: I was in the Redcoat Marching Band at UGA while I was an undergrad! Here I am waiting for the Rose Bowl Parade to start (it was an awesome exhausting day!)"

For all that curiosity, so few people get to go into space and only a small fraction of people work with the final frontier! NASA has a program called the Universe of Learning that helps people learn about how their work is done and try to discover space themselves. Within the Universe of Learning, the Exoplanet Watch asks volunteers to help map other solar systems by either collecting data using telescopes or performing data analysis to measure how many planets are in a solar system, their relative size, even if the center star has its own rotation. Very cool, and I think it would be an excellent class project for STEM classes to explore!"
